My structured WIP plan to learn Houdini.

---

### history Originally started this plan in LucidChart, mapping the outline and adding notes and links as comments of the nodes. I ran into some issues that bothered me:
1. free version has a node limitation 
2. comment icons were huge when zoomed out (birdseye view)
3. my notes/comments were stored inline

So I started looking at other software that combined mindmaps and markdown creation. The mindmap would be great for laying out an outline of topics and restructing them, and markdown is a clean way to add text, links, images and videos (youtube &amp; vimeo). 

I started researching I found the following:

[gitnote](https://github.com/zhaopengme/gitnote) - A modern note taking app based on GIT

[NoteLynX Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.astrodean.notelynxpro&amp;hl=en_GB) - 3-in-1 Outliner, Mindmap and Personal Wiki. An Outliner for Hierarchical Lists, a Mindmap for Graphical Tree View and embedded Hyperlinks to cross reference your notes.

[markdown-mindmap](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-mindmap) - Visualize markdown files as mindmaps in Atom editor

[WriteMapper 2](https://writemapper.com/) - The content writing tool for visual thinkers to quickly and easily produce text documents using mind maps.

[Curio 13](https://www.zengobi.com/curio/) - Curio is an intuitive, freeform notebook environment with all the integrated tools you need to take notes, brainstorm ideas, collect research, and organize your tasks and documents.

[MindForger](https://www.mindforger.com/) - Thinking Notebook &amp; Markdown IDE
