# houHow
My structured WIP plan to learn Houdini.




---
### history
Originally started this plan in LucidChart, mapping the outline and adding notes and links as comments of the nodes.  I ran into some issues that bothered me:

1. free version has a node limitation
2. comment icons were huge when zoomed out (birdseye view)
3. my notes/comments were stored inline

So I started looking at other software that combined mindmaps and markdown creation.  The mindmap would be great for laying out an outline of topics and restructing them, and markdown is a clean way to add text, links, images and videos (youtube & vimeo).

I started researching I found the following:
