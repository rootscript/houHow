I ran into some issues that bothered me:\n\n1. free version has a node limitation\n2. comment icons were huge when zoomed out (birdseye view)\n3. my notes/comments were stored inline\n\nSo I started looking at other software that combined mindmaps and markdown creation.  The mindmap would be great for laying out an outline of topics and restructing them, and markdown is a clean way to add text, links, images and videos (youtube & vimeo).\n\nI started researching I found the following:\n\n[gitnote](https://github.com/zhaopengme/gitnote) - A modern note taking app based on GIT\n\n[NoteLynX Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.astrodean.notelynxpro&hl=en_GB) - 3-in-1 Outliner, Mindmap and Personal Wiki.
