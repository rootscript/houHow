Files could be edited in the browser/IOS app/Android app, and stored in Google Drive (so not bad, cross platform & data accessable from anywhere as LucidChart has a Google Drive integration also). I ran into some issues that bothered & limited me (to the point where I didn't want to put all my eggs in one proprietry format):\n\n1. free version has a node limitation\n2. comment icons were huge when zoomed out (birdseye view)\n3. my notes/comments were stored inline\n\n![title](.local/static/2019/10/3/Houdini18_plan_lucidChart.1573042987114.svg)\n\nSo I started looking at other software that combined mindmaps and markdown creation.
